# Unix Epochalypse Countdown

The Unix clock has been ticking since 1970, and just watch what will happen when it reaches the end in 2038.

## What’s the Unix Epochalypse?

The Unix Epochalypse (or the Year 2038 problem) is the day clocks on a number of systems will flip from January 19, 2038 3:14:08 AM UTC to December 13, 1901 8:45:52 PM UTC. This is because of the use of a 32-bit signed integer for the current seconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the Unix epoch. Values only from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 are stored. When finally reaching the limit, it’ll be the seconds before the epoch starting at the lowest supported integer.

If you have yet to make the complete shift to 64-bit, expect some strange things to happen later. The age of 32-bit is over. The time of 64-bit has come!
